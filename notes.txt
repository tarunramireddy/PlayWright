const {test, expect} = require('@playwright/test')

test("home page test", async({page}) => {})

async has to be used because in JS activities are not done just one after the other by default. So using async we can make sure that second activity is processed only after first one is done.

await page.goto('');
await page.title();
await page.close();

await page.locator('').click();
await page.click('');

await page.fill('locator', 'value')
await page.type('locator', 'value')
await ele.textContent()

multiple element: const Elements = await page.$$('')


assertions:
await expect(page).toHaveTitle('')
await expect(page).toHaveURL('')
await expect(locator).toBeVisible();


-------------------------- specific locators -----------------------
page.getByRole() to locate by explicit and implicit accessibility attributes.
page.getByText() to locate by text content.
page.getByLabel() to locate a form control by associated label's text.
page.getByPlaceholder() to locate an input by placeholder.
page.getByAltText() to locate an element, usually image, by its text alternative.
page.getByTitle() to locate an element by its title attribute.
page.getByTestId() to locate an element based on its data-testid attribute
